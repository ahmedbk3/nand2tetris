# Nand2Tetris Journey – Ahmed Ben Kilani

## About Me
Hi! I’m Ahmed Ben Kilani, a Networks & Telecommunications student at INSAT with a strong interest in **computer architecture, low-level systems, and how computers really work**.  
I’m also a musician and enjoy combining creativity from both worlds — tech and art, so found out that nand2tetris is the way to go.

## About This Repository
This repository contains all my work and progress for the **Nand2Tetris course**.  
The course walks through building a computer from the ground up:
- Starting from basic logic gates (NAND).
- Building adders, memory, and the ALU.
- Constructing a full CPU and assembler.
- Eventually running programs and building a simple operating system.

## Why I’m Doing This
- Strengthen my foundations in computer systems.  
- Better understand how high-level code maps to hardware.  
- Challenge myself with hands-on projects beyond theory.  


## Tools Used
- Hardware Simulator  
- CPU Emulator  
- Assembler  
- My Git + GitHub workflow
